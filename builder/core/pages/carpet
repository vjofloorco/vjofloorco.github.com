<p>Whether you are looking for carpet suitable for an apartment, rental property, a commercial environment, or your own home Vallejo Floor Company has a superb selection of different grades and styles of carpet for every situation.  With several manufacturers, dozens of lines, and hundreds of options to chose from we are sure to have the carpet that is right for you and our knowledgeable staff will be more than happy to answer any carpeting questions you may have and guide you through the selection process.</p>
<p>We offer a full range of carpets from Mohawk, the world's largest carpet manufacturer.  Mohawk's new SmartStrand carpets feature their proprietary Triexta fiber developed in conjunction with Dupont.  This material is engineered to handle wear and staining incredibly well, making it both a perfect choice for high-traffic and common household areas.  As an added benefit, Mohawk's carpet based on their Triexta fibers are significantly softer than regular P.E.T., polyester, and nylon yarn.  SmartStrand Silk, the latest addition to Mohawk's line of residential carpets, takes softness to the next level by utilizing narrower fibers to create a carpet unlike anything you have ever felt before.</p>
