<p>Vinyl flooring has changed quite a bit over the last several years and is no longer the dull-looking high-maintenance product that it once was.  New innovations and advancements in vinyl manufacturing have paved the way for several new styles that not only look and feel incredibly realistic but prove to be durable in high-traffic environments as well.</p>
<p>We offer Mohawk's <a href="http://www.congoleum.com" target="new">Congoleum</a> (including <a href="http://www.congoleum.com/product_options.php?process=true&amp;collection=DuraCeramic" target="new">Congoleum DuraCeramic</a> tiles), which is a high-quality U.S.-made product with several different grades and styles/colors to chose from.  Some of Congoleum's offerings are also Scotchguard protected, allowing for quick and easy cleanup and stain prevention in kitchen, bathroom, laundry area, and mud room environments.</p>

<p>We also offer both Tarkett <a href="http://www.tarkettna.com/Products/FiberFloor" target="new">FiberFloor</a> and IVC US's <a href="http://www.ivcgroup.us" target="new">FLEXITEC</a> line, both of which are manufactured in the U.S. and take durability and performance to the next level by sporting fiberglass-reinforced structures that make them significantly more tear and rip-resistant than traditional vinyl floor products.  As an added advantage these products provide a superior level of under-foot comfort.</p>

<p>Last but not least, we also offer Luxury Vinyl Planking (LVP); the latest trend in the resilient flooring market.  Unlike traditional vinyl which is installed as sheet/roll goods, LVP is installed as individual planks which can be removed and replaced individually if they are ever damaged, making it an attractive choice for both high-traffic residential and light-commercial environments.  Here at Vallejo Floor Company we are proud to offer both Drop &amp; Done and <a href="http://www.karndean.com">Karndean</a> products.</p>
