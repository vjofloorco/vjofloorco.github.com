<p>Vallejo Floor Company can help you to update your kitchen or bathroom storage solutions in order to take advantage of your space and to make if function more efficiently for you; all whilst giving you a clean and updated look that ties in perfectly with your existing or planned decor.  Here at Vallejo Floor Company, we carry the <a href="http://www.kempercabinets.com/" target="_blank">Kemper</a> and <a href="http://www.aristokraft.com/" target="_blank">Aristokraft</a> cabinet lines, both of which offer a semi-customized solution with a four-week lead-time.  What this ultimately means is that you can have a cabinet design and layout unique to your needs and tastes all without paying the exorbitant costs of full-on custom work.</p>
<p>Because we realize how difficult it may be for a homeowner to plan their designs and layouts on their own, we are more than willing to provide you with a free estimation and design consultation; allowing you to know exactly what you're getting and even see what it will look like before you make any decisions or invest any money into your project.  Our design consultations will also allow you to coordinate other aspects of your project, such as flooring and countertops.</p>
